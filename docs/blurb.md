# THERMITE

**DROP IN. BLOW UP. GET OUT.**

Experience the ruthless tension of an extraction shooter distilled into pure, grid-based strategy. **Thermite** fuses the explosive, tactical combat of *Bomberman* with the high-stakes risk/reward of *Escape from Tarkov*.

In this volatile 5-minute raid, every tile matters. Move with precision, place your explosives, and trap your enemies in a deadly game of cat and mouse. Your goal? Loot the facility, secure the bag, and extract before the timer—or your rivals—blow you to dust.

*   **TACTICAL GRID COMBAT:** Outthink, don't just outgun. Master blast patterns and map control in a game where positioning is everything.
*   **HIGH STAKES EXTRACTION:** Death is permanent. Lose your fight, lose your gear. Will you risk your best loadout for the hot zone loot?
*   **RAPID FIRE RAIDS:** All the adrenaline of a 40-minute raid compressed into a 5-minute blitz. Perfect for the "just one more run" mentality.
*   **SURVIVABLE ECONOMY:** Hit rock bottom? No problem. Scavenge the edges and rebuild a competitive kit in under 20 minutes.

**Survive the Blast. Secure the Loot.**
