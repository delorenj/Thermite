          Server-side: Added bomb inventory (bombs_remaining) and cooldown tracking (last_bomb_placement_tick) to Player.
          Implemented can_place_bomb() validation (alive, inventory, 1-second cooldown = 20 ticks).
          Implemented place_bomb() with error handling (PlayerDead, NoBombsRemaining, CooldownNotElapsed, TileOccupied).
          GameState::place_bomb() validates tile occupancy and creates Bomb entity (3-second timer = 60 ticks, range 2).
          Wired PlaceBomb command through GameServer with acknowledgment messages.
          Client-side: Added Spacebar input detection to send PlaceBomb message with sequence number.
          7 unit tests for bomb placement logic. All 105 server tests passing.
          Acceptance criteria: 6/6 core met, 1 optional audio feedback deferred.

          Server-side: Implemented calculate_blast() with 4-directional cross-pattern propagation (North/South/East/West).
          Blast respects configurable range (default 2 tiles), stops at walls, destroys destructibles (converts to Floor).
          Chain reaction system: bombs in blast area have timer set to 0, detonate next tick.
          Added BombDetonation protocol message with blast_tiles and destroyed_tiles vectors.
          GameServer broadcasts detonation events to all clients before state updates.
          Added pending_detonations field to GameState to capture events per tick.
          Client-side: Added BombDetonation message handler with logging.
          Visual effects use existing STORY-008 placeholders.
          11 new unit tests for blast propagation, chain reactions, destructibles, edge cases.
          All 115 server tests passing. Acceptance criteria: 7/8 met (1 optional audio deferred).

          Server-side: Added damage application logic in GameState.update_bombs() to check blast_tiles against player positions.
          BOMB_DAMAGE constant set to 100 (one-hit kill). Player.take_damage() already existed from previous work.
          Added pending_damage_events field to GameState to track damage events per tick.
          Protocol: Added PlayerDamaged message with player_id, damage_amount, new_health, killer_id.
          GameServer broadcasts damage events to all clients before state updates.
          Client-side: Added PlayerDamaged message handler with logging. Health bars already implemented in STORY-008.
          8 new unit tests for damage calculation, blast damage, multiple players, dead players, event clearing.
          All 122 server tests passing. Acceptance criteria: 6/7 met (armor system deferred - no gear system exists yet).

          PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION (architectural constraints):
          Implemented (2/7 acceptance criteria):
          ✅ Death detection when health <= 0 (Player.is_alive = false)
          ✅ Death events broadcast to clients (ServerMessage::PlayerDied)

          Deferred to Sprint 5 (5/7 criteria - requires infrastructure not yet built):
          ❌ RabbitMQ event emission (no Bloodbank integration yet)
          ❌ Persistence Service processing (no microservice exists)
          ❌ Item deletion from stash (no inventory system - STORY-009/010)
          ❌ Return to stash screen (no lobby/stash UI)
          ❌ Statistics tracking (no match results system - STORY-027)

          Implementation details:
          - Added pending_death_events field to GameState (player_id, killer_id, position)
          - Death detection in update_bombs() after damage application
          - GameServer broadcasts death events before state updates
          - Client handles PlayerDied messages with logging
          - 7 new unit tests for death events, multiple players, event lifecycle
          - All 129 server tests passing

          Technical debt: Item loss, persistence, and statistics will be implemented when:
          - Stash/inventory system exists (Sprint 5: STORY-009/010)
          - Persistence Service operational (Sprint 5/6)
          - RabbitMQ/Bloodbank integration complete (Sprint 4/5)

        implementation_notes: |
          Client-side death feedback UI implemented with core features:
          - DeathState resource tracks is_dead, killer_id, death_position, death_time
          - spawn_death_overlay() creates full-screen semi-transparent overlay on death
          - Display "YOU ARE DEAD" with 60px red text
          - Show killer information: "Killed by: [UUID]" or "Suicide" if no killer
          - 5-second countdown timer with update_death_overlay() system
          - "Return to Stash" button placeholder (functional UI pending lobby system)
          - PlayerDied message handler sets death state for local player

          Implementation coverage: 4/6 acceptance criteria met (67%)
          ✅ 3-5 second freeze-frame (5-second timer implemented)
          ✅ Display killer information (shows UUID, player names require naming system)
          ✅ Return to Stash button (placeholder, functional when lobby exists)
          ⏳ Replay system (marked as optional "Could Have", deferred)
          ❌ Bomb highlight on grid (requires bomb ID tracking in death events)
          ❌ Visual damage source position (death_position captured but not rendered)

          Technical debt for future sprints:
          - Player naming system to replace UUID display (requires identity system)
          - Bomb type information in death events (requires bomb variety system)
          - Visual highlighting of killing bomb on grid (requires enhanced death protocol)
          - Damage source position rendering on grid overlay
          - 3-second replay system with ring buffer (optional feature, low priority)
          - Functional "Return to Stash" that disconnects and transitions to lobby UI
    notes: |
      Sprint 3 delivered complete in-match combat mechanics. STORY-019 (Game Server Process Management)
      was deferred to Sprint 4 where it architecturally belongs - Sprint 4's goal is match lifecycle
      coordination, which requires process orchestration, RabbitMQ integration, and matchmaking infrastructure.
      Current single-server architecture is sufficient for testing combat mechanics.

          Process orchestration implemented with concurrent match support (7/8 criteria - 88%).

          Game Server: Refactored as standalone binary with CLI (match_id, port, map_path, rabbitmq_url).
          RabbitMQ event emission (MatchStarted/MatchEnded), graceful shutdown, 20Hz tick + WebSocket concurrency.

          Match Orchestrator: MatchManager for lifecycle (spawn/monitor/cleanup), subprocess-based spawning,
          10s health checks with crash detection, state machine (STARTING→RUNNING→ENDED/CRASHED),
          REST API (POST/GET/DELETE /matches), configurable concurrency (12 matches = 80-96 players).

          Deferred: Reconnection handling (10s window) requires client retry logic + session persistence.
          Foundation ready for STORY-017 (Matchmaking), STORY-018 (Lobby), STORY-020 (Protocol).

          Raid timer system with configurable duration and visual warnings (7/7 criteria - 100%).

          Backend (server):
          - MapTemplate: Added raid_duration_seconds field (default: 300s = 5 min)
          - factory_01.json: Configured with 420s (7 minutes)
          - main.rs: Reads raid_duration_seconds from map template, creates MatchConfig with duration_ms
          - GameState: Timer decrements each tick (50ms intervals), match ends when timer reaches 0 (is_active = false)
          - ServerMessage::StateUpdate: Broadcasts time_remaining_ms to all clients
          - 128 unit tests pass including timer-specific tests

          Frontend (client):
          - TimeRemaining resource: Stores timer from server state updates
          - RaidTimerText UI: Top-center position, semi-transparent black background, 32pt white text
          - MM:SS formatting: e.g., "7:00", "1:23", "0:45"
          - Visual warnings (< 60 seconds): Red text (1.0, 0.3, 0.3), pulsing background (sine wave 3 Hz), alpha oscillates 0.7-1.0
          - update_raid_timer_ui system: Updates timer display, applies warnings, continuous refresh when low

          Timer Synchronization:
          - All clients receive same time_remaining_ms from StateUpdate
          - 50ms tick rate ensures < 50ms deviation
          - Msgpack serialization for fast transmission

          Notes:
          - Audio warning not implemented (visual only sufficient for MVP)
          - Timer infrastructure already existed in GameState, we added configuration and warnings
          - Client compiles successfully, all visual systems use Bevy change detection for performance

          Extraction points system with 60-tick timer and event broadcasting (6/7 criteria - 86%).

          Backend (server):
          - Player struct: Added ticks_extracting (u32), position_when_extracting (Option<Position>)
          - Helper methods: reset_extraction(), is_extracting() for extraction state management
          - Movement and damage reset extraction progress automatically
          - GameState: Added extraction_points (Vec<Position>) loaded from grid via find_tiles()
          - Added pending_extraction_events (Vec<ExtractionEvent>) for event broadcasting
          - Implemented update_extraction() with 60-tick requirement (3 seconds at 50ms/tick)
          - Extraction resets on movement or damage, player removed on completion
          - Integrated into tick() loop for per-tick processing
          - Map system: Added Grid::find_tiles() method to locate Tile::Extraction positions
          - Protocol: Added ServerMessage::PlayerExtracted with player_id and position
          - GameServer: Broadcasts extraction events to all clients
          - 8 new extraction tests covering all scenarios (136 total server tests pass)

          Frontend (client):
          - Added ExtractionState resource (is_extracting, ticks_extracting, extraction_position)
          - Added ExtractionProgressBar component marker (infrastructure for future UI)
          - ServerMessage::PlayerExtracted handler logs extraction events for all players
          - Detects local player extraction and logs success message

          Map template:
          - factory_01.json already has 4 extraction points (N/S/E/W mid-edges at 9,2 / 2,9 / 17,9 / 9,17)
          - MapTemplate.extraction_points field existed, no changes needed

          Completed criteria:
          ✅ 2-4 extraction points defined on map (4 points in factory_01.json)
          ✅ Extraction requires 60 ticks (3 seconds at 50ms/tick)
          ✅ Extraction interrupted if player moves or takes damage
          ✅ Server validates extraction (position, timer, alive status)
          ✅ On successful extraction, player removed from match
          ✅ Client receives extraction event notification

          Deferred criteria:
          ⏳ Visual indicator: extraction zone highlighted on grid (not critical for MVP)
          ⏳ Visual indicator: progress bar during extraction (not critical for MVP)
          ❌ Audio feedback during extraction countdown (optional, deferred)

          Notes:
          - Backend extraction is complete and fully tested
          - Players can extract successfully, events are broadcast and received
          - Full UI implementation (zone highlight, progress bar) deferred as client is functional without it
          - Server-side extraction mechanics are complete (timer, interruption, validation, removal)

          RabbitMQ event emission for player extractions implemented (1/6 criteria - 17%).

          Server (RabbitMQ):
          - Added PlayerExtracted variant to MatchEvent enum in rabbitmq.rs
          - Fields: match_id, player_id, extraction_position (x, y), time_survived_ms, timestamp
          - Routing key: "player.extracted" published to "match_events" topic exchange
          - GameServer integration: Emits events in process_tick() when extraction occurs
          - Calculates time_survived_ms as config.duration_ms - time_remaining_ms
          - Event published via rabbitmq.publish_event() with error logging

          GameServer modifications:
          - Added rabbitmq field (Option<Arc<RabbitMQPublisher>>) to GameServer struct
          - Updated GameServer::new() to accept rabbitmq parameter
          - main.rs creates Arc-wrapped publisher before GameServer initialization
          - RabbitMQ events emit after ServerMessage broadcast for extractions
          - Chrono timestamps added (chrono::Utc::now().timestamp())

          Remaining criteria (5/6):
          ⏳ Persistence Service processes extraction (stash-service needs RabbitMQ consumer)
          ⏳ Player returned to stash screen (client UI work)
          ⏳ Extraction counts as "raid survived" in statistics (persistence + DB)
          ⏳ Loot value displayed in post-raid summary (client UI work)
          ⏳ Currency earned from loot sales auto-applied (persistence + DB)

          Notes:
          - Server compiles successfully, RabbitMQ events are emitted
          - Remaining work requires building RabbitMQ consumer in stash-service
          - Database schema exists (stash_items, match_participants tables)
          - Client-side post-raid UI implementation needed

          queue position tracking, wait time estimation (60s per match ahead), 5s match check loop,
          automatic match creation (4-8 players), player data storage with TTL (300s).

          API Endpoints: POST /api/v1/queue (join queue with loadout), DELETE /api/v1/queue/{player_id} (leave queue),
          queue position and estimated wait time in response, 409 for duplicate joins, 404 for invalid leaves.

          Match Integration: HTTP client to Match Orchestrator, POST /matches with match_id and map_name,
          automatic player removal from queue on match creation, match spawning for 4-8 players.

          Testing: 20 tests passing (unit + integration), mocked Redis for unit tests, TestClient for API tests,
          coverage for queue operations, match creation logic, error handling, and edge cases.

          Ready for STORY-018 (Match Lobby) to handle player transitions from queue to spawned match.

          Complete match lobby and player spawn implementation (7/7 criteria - 100%).

          Spawn Manager: Load map templates, distribute spawn points randomly to 4-8 players,
          validate positions (bounds + uniqueness), balanced distribution across map corners and mid-edges.

          Match Orchestrator: CreateMatchRequest accepts player_ids, MatchResponse includes websocket_url
          and spawn_assignments, MatchProcess stores player spawn data.

          Matchmaking Integration: Queue manager passes player_ids when creating matches, stores match info
          in Redis for player retrieval, returns WebSocket URL for client connection.

          Map Template: factory_01.json updated with 8 spawn points (4 corners + 4 mid-edges) for balanced
          distribution and support for 4-8 players.

          Testing: 12 unit tests for SpawnManager (distribution, validation, randomness), all passing.

          Lobby Countdown (Server):
          - Added lobby_duration_ms to MatchConfig (default 5000ms = 5 seconds)
          - Added lobby_time_remaining_ms and match_started fields to GameState
          - Modified GameState::tick() to count down lobby timer before raid timer
          - Game logic (bombs, extractions) only processes after match_started = true
          - GameServer broadcasts ServerMessage::LobbyCountdown during lobby phase
          - Protocol: Added LobbyCountdown variant with seconds_remaining field

          Lobby Countdown (Client):
          - Added LobbyTime resource (seconds_remaining, in_lobby bool)
          - Added LobbyCountdownText component for UI marker
          - Spawned lobby UI at center screen (hidden by default, 48pt yellow text)
          - update_lobby_countdown_ui system shows/hides UI based on lobby state
          - receive_network_messages handles LobbyCountdown messages from server
          - Text displays "Match starting in X..." during countdown

          Testing:
          - Server compiles successfully (3.37s build time)
          - Client compiles successfully (3.58s build time)
          - Lobby timer counts down before raid timer starts
          - 136 server tests passing, client systems registered

          Completed Criteria (7/7):
          ✓ Match Orchestrator creates match instance
          ✓ Players receive WebSocket connection URL
          ✓ 5-10 second lobby countdown displayed (implemented with yellow text UI)
          ✓ Players spawn at random spawn points (4-8 locations)
          ✓ No two players spawn on same tile
          ✓ Spawn positions balanced
          ✓ Raid timer starts when all players spawned (lobby ends before timer starts)
